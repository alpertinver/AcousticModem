# AcousticModem
AcousticModem For Sound Transmission 
The goal of the project is to make an acoustic modem using Matlab application. The purpose 
of the acoustic modem is to convert the analog audio input into binary data by on-off coding or 
manchester coding, then transmit the data using one of the qam, psk or fsk modulation methods, 
and remove the noise affecting the signal on the receiver side by applying a matched filter and 
demodulate the data to analog audio output.
